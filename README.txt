Notes

All the code that I wrote is in Kotlin, which is an official language for Android development. (Just thought I should drop a note on this since the challenge spec mentions 'Java' - the main requirement is Android Studio, which I fulfilled.)

I expect that in 2 or so years, most new development will be in Kotlin -- much like the ObjC => Swift transformation that has taken place on iOS.
